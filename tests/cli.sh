# Tests what the flake's checks cannot run in the Nix sandbox, because it
# needs the network or runs Nix. Each section is a contract check that a CI
# job runs by name:
#
# - relock: a relock of each fixture reproduces its committed lockfile
#   (conformance-relock).
# - interactive: `swift` runs and (on Linux) tests on the locked
#   dependencies; with a stale lockfile it stops and names
#   `swiftpm-purifier lock`; `swiftpm-purifier uninstall` removes the
#   links; `--lockfile` and SWIFTPM_PURIFIER_LOCKFILE use a lockfile kept
#   outside the package.
# - tampered: a lockfile whose hash of an entry was changed, and whose
#   contentHash was recomputed to match, fails the fetch with a hash
#   mismatch.
# - rebuild: `nix build --rebuild` of a fixture gives the same output
#   (conformance-rebuild).
# - offline: after `swiftpm-purifier prefetch`, `swift build`, `swift test`
#   (on Linux) and `swift run` work with no network (conformance-offline). The
#   commands run under `unshare -rn`, or under the command prefix in
#   SWIFTPM_PURIFIER_TEST_OFFLINE.
# - update: `swiftpm-purifier update` moves a pin of an old version forward
#   in Package.resolved and in the purifier lockfile, and both then pass the
#   stale check (conformance-update).
# - registry: a dependency from a package registry, against a stand-in
#   registry (tests/registry.py): `swiftpm-purifier publish` uploads a
#   package's source archive, a second package depends on it by registry
#   identity, its lock records the archive, Nix builds it, and `swift run`
#   runs it with the registry gone.
#
# Run it from anywhere: tests/cli.sh [section...]. Without arguments it
# runs every section.
