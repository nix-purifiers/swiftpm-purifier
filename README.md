# swiftpm-purifier

swiftpm-purifier keeps SwiftPM's development workflow on locked,
Nix-resolved dependencies. Use the normal build and test commands in your
working tree; building the project itself in the Nix sandbox is an
optional next step.

## Quickstart

From the project root:

```zsh
nix shell 'github:nix-purifiers/swiftpm-purifier#toolchain'
swiftpm-purifier lock
swift build
swift test
```

Commit the lockfiles that the lock command writes, including the build
tool's own lockfile when it has one. Keep using the project's usual build,
test and editor commands with this setup. Nix provides the locked
dependencies; the development commands above run outside the Nix sandbox.
No project Nix files are needed for this workflow.

Sandboxed builds of the whole project are an optional
[next step](#building-the-project-with-nix).

The shell provides the `swift` wrapper. Use it for the locked
development workflow. With no purifier lockfile, it warns on standard
error and runs the ordinary tool with impure resolution.

For persistent use, add these packages through your usual Nix configuration.


## Development loop

`nix shell 'github:nix-purifiers/swiftpm-purifier#toolchain'` gives a shell whose
`swift` runs through `swiftpm-purifier swift`. In a package with an
up-to-date lockfile, `swift build`, `swift test` and `swift run` use the
locked dependencies, which the shell links into `Packages/` and
`.build/artifacts/` from the Nix store. Outside that shell, run
`swiftpm-purifier swift build`.

`swiftpm-purifier` is a standalone command that runs SwiftPM, not a SwiftPM
package plugin. `swiftpm-purifier lock` records the downloads and keeps the
pins of `Package.resolved` as they are. It relocks when `Package.swift` or the pins
changed since the lockfile was made, and `relock` relocks regardless. A
relock of an unchanged package reproduces the lockfile byte for byte.

`swiftpm-purifier update [<package>...]` updates the pins through the
`swift package update` command of SwiftPM, for every package or the named
ones, and then relocks the lockfile against the result.

`swiftpm-purifier publish <scope.name> <version>` builds the `release` with
Nix and uploads it (SE-0391) to the registry configured for the scope, or
to `--registry <url>`. `SWIFTPM_PURIFIER_REGISTRY_TOKEN` is sent as a
bearer token.

For an external build, every command takes `--lockfile <path>` and
`--tool-lockfile <path>`, or reads `SWIFTPM_PURIFIER_LOCKFILE` and
`SWIFTPM_PURIFIER_TOOL_LOCKFILE`. Either one takes precedence over the
default location. The dev shell of a flake that calls the builder can set
both variables to the paths it passes as `lockFile` and `packageResolved`.

## Building the project with Nix

Once the native development workflow is working, you can also build and
test the whole project in the Nix sandbox. For this step, keep a flake or
another Nix build definition in the project's repository, or maintain an
external packaging repository that points at its sources and lockfiles.
The builder consumes the same lockfiles as the development workflow.

The flake adds one attribute to the package set: the scope
`pkgs.swiftpm-purifier`, which holds the builder `buildSwiftPMProject`, the
`swiftpm-purifier` command as `cli`, and the Swift `toolchain`.

A project whose authors want a flake can package the project with one. The
flake can live in the repository of the project or in another one, and it
calls the builder directly:

```nix
{
  inputs.swiftpm-purifier.url =
    "github:nix-purifiers/swiftpm-purifier";
  inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "swiftpm-purifier/nixpkgs";

  outputs =
    {
      self,
      nixpkgs,
      swiftpm-purifier,
      ...
    }:
    let
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      pkgs = import nixpkgs {
        inherit system;
        overlays = [
          swiftpm-purifier.overlays.default
        ];
      };
      project =
        pkgs.swiftpm-purifier.buildSwiftPMProject {
        src = self;
      };
    in
    {
      packages.${system}.default =
        project.packages.hello;
      checks.${system}.tests = project.tests;
    };
}
```

A package in an overlay that takes the scope as `{ swiftpm-purifier }:` calls
`swiftpm-purifier.buildSwiftPMProject` the same way.

`buildSwiftPMProject` takes these arguments:

- `src`, the root of the package.
- `lockFile`, which defaults to `swiftpm-purifier.lock.json` in `src` and
  may lie outside it.
- `packageResolved`, which defaults to `Package.resolved` in `src`. A copy
  kept outside the repository replaces the one in `src` in the build.
- `fetchers`, which goes unchanged to `fetchEntry` of the purifier library,
  so a company mirror or credentials go into `fetchers.fetchurl`.
- `buildConfig`, `release` (the default) or `debug`.
- `artifactBuildInputs`, libraries that the prebuilt files of binary
  targets need beyond the C and C++ runtime, curl, libxml2, zlib, OpenSSL,
  SQLite and ICU.
- Any argument of `stdenv.mkDerivation`.

It returns:

- `packages.<product>`, one per product of the package. An executable is
  its binary under `bin/`. A dynamic or static library is its library file
  under `lib/` with its Swift modules. SwiftPM publishes an automatic
  library, a plugin and a macro as source, so their package is the source
  archive of the package.
- `tests`, the build with `swift test` run in the sandbox, on Linux only
  (nixpkgs' Swift has no XCTest runner on macOS).
- `release`, the source archive of the package, which a package registry
  serves and `swiftpm-purifier publish` uploads.
- `fetches`, the purifier library entries that the build fetches.
- `project`, the build with every product installed, and `tree`, the locked
  dependencies laid out for SwiftPM.

The builder is a package for `callPackage` in that scope. It takes
`swiftPackages`, `runCommand`, `zip`, `unzip`, `zstd`, `python3`,
`writeText`, `fetchurl`, `fetchgit` and the purifier library by name.
`swiftpm-purifier.buildSwiftPMProject.override` replaces any of them, and
`swiftpm-purifier.overrideScope` replaces what everything in the scope
shares.

`lib.swiftpm-purifier.readLock { src, lockFile ? ..., packageResolved ? ... }`
gives the lock in memory of the purifier contract:
`{ purifier, entries, outputs, problems }`. `problems` is empty for a usable
lock.

We recommend committing both lockfiles to the repository of the project.
The builder and the commands look for them there by default.

A flake can instead keep a build external: the flake that calls the builder
keeps the lockfiles outside the repository and passes them as `lockFile` and
`packageResolved`. This builds a project whose author commits neither
lockfile, or whose committed `Package.resolved` is stale or comes from
another version of SwiftPM. The commands take `--lockfile <path>` and
`--tool-lockfile <path>` for the two files, or the variables
`SWIFTPM_PURIFIER_LOCKFILE` and `SWIFTPM_PURIFIER_TOOL_LOCKFILE`. With
`--tool-lockfile`, `lock` and `update` write the `Package.resolved` there and
leave the copy in the tree as it is, and `lock` starts from the copy in the
tree when the outside one does not exist yet.

### One-off builds without a project Nix file

For an ad hoc build, the builder can also be evaluated directly from the
project root. Replace the example package name with one from your project:

```zsh
nix build --impure --expr 'let
  purifier = builtins.getFlake "github:nix-purifiers/swiftpm-purifier";
  pkgs = import purifier.inputs.nixpkgs {
    system = builtins.currentSystem;
    overlays = [ purifier.overlays.default ];
  };
in
(pkgs.swiftpm-purifier.buildSwiftPMProject { src = ./.; })
.packages.hello'
```

This uses the purifier's pinned nixpkgs, matching the lock command above.
To build with ambient `<nixpkgs>` from your Nix search path instead,
replace `import purifier.inputs.nixpkgs` with `import <nixpkgs>`.
Both forms need no Nix files in your project. The build tool and language
versions must match the lockfile; with ambient nixpkgs, lock with the
purifier from that package set or pass a compatible toolchain to the builder.

## Working offline

`swiftpm-purifier prefetch` realizes in the Nix store the locked
dependencies and the toolchain, which includes sourcekit-lsp. It links the
dependencies into the package, writes the workspace state that marks them
as edited, and keeps everything alive with a garbage-collector root under
`.build/swiftpm-purifier`. After a prefetch, `swift build`, `swift test` and
`swift run` work with the network cut off. `swiftpm-purifier uninstall`
removes the links. The default `.gitignore` that SwiftPM writes already
ignores `/Packages`.

## Editor

The toolchain includes sourcekit-lsp, and `prefetch` also writes the
workspace state into `.build/index-build`, where sourcekit-lsp builds its
background index. Editor support does not work yet: the sourcekit-lsp 6.3.3
in nixpkgs cannot find the SourceKit plugin of its toolchain and cannot
create a build server, so it resolves no symbols, with or without
swiftpm-purifier.

## Troubleshooting

A lockfile that is stale, changed by hand, malformed or incomplete fails
in the command and at Nix evaluation, with a message that names the command
that fixes it.

| Message | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `is out of date with Package.resolved` or `with Package.swift` | The pins or the manifests changed since the lock run. | `swiftpm-purifier lock` |
| `does not match its contentHash` | The lockfile was edited after the lock run wrote it. | `swiftpm-purifier relock` |
| `lacks <field>` or `is not valid JSON` | The lockfile is incomplete or damaged. | `swiftpm-purifier relock` |
| `has lock format version N` | The lockfile is from another version of swiftpm-purifier. | `swiftpm-purifier relock` with the version that the flake pins |
| `hash mismatch` | The content of a download differs from the recorded hash. | Check the source, then `swiftpm-purifier relock` |

`swiftpm-purifier swift` stops with a stale lockfile, where SwiftPM would
resolve and download what the lock does not hold.

## Supported language repositories

| What SwiftPM fetched | What the lockfile records | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A package from git (`.package(url:)`) | the content hash by `nix-prefetch-git`, with submodules; the fetch URL when a mirror replaces the location | supported |
| A package from a registry (`.package(id:)`) | the URL of the source archive that the registry serves, and its hash | supported |
| A remote binary target (`.binaryTarget(url:checksum:)`) | the URL, with the checksum of the manifest | supported |
| A package by path (`.package(path:)`) | where it is | part of the source |
| A local binary target (`.binaryTarget(path:)`) | where it is | part of the source |
| A git repository on the local disk | nothing | refused, because it exists on one machine only; depend on it by path or by its remote URL |
| Prebuilt swift-syntax libraries | nothing | refused; the build and `swift` pass `--disable-experimental-prebuilts` and build swift-syntax from source |

The lockfile entries follow the entry shapes of
[purifier](https://github.com/nix-purifiers/purifier), the library that the
nix-purifiers share, and that library fetches them. The lock run refuses a
dependency whose SwiftPM workspace state it cannot derive from
`Package.resolved`. Binary targets ship prebuilt files for other systems,
so on Linux the build patches their ELF executables and libraries with
`autoPatchelfHook` to run under Nix.

x86_64-linux and aarch64-darwin are the supported systems, so the flake's
checks run there and not on aarch64-linux; CI runs on x86_64-linux. nixpkgs
marks its Swift 6.3 compiler broken on aarch64-linux, where it fails to
link with the gold linker, and aarch64-linux joins the flake's systems once
nixpkgs updates to Swift 6.4, which links with LLD. On macOS the builds use
nixpkgs' Swift and Apple SDK rather than Xcode, and `tests` doesn't run
there: nixpkgs' Swift has no XCTest runner on macOS.

## Examples

For day-to-day work on these projects, use the native-tool setup and
commands in [Quickstart](#quickstart) and [Development loop](#development-loop).
The Nix expressions below show optional sandboxed packaging of those
projects.

### vapor/toolbox

[vapor/toolbox](https://github.com/vapor/toolbox) is the command-line tool
of the Vapor web framework. It commits `Package.resolved` and no purifier
lockfile.

Lock the tool at a release, and build it from the clone:

```zsh
nix shell 'github:nix-purifiers/swiftpm-purifier#toolchain'
git clone --branch 20.0.2 https://github.com/vapor/toolbox
cd toolbox
swiftpm-purifier lock
nix build --impure --expr 'let
  purifier = builtins.getFlake "github:nix-purifiers/swiftpm-purifier";
  pkgs = import purifier.inputs.nixpkgs {
    system = builtins.currentSystem;
    overlays = [ purifier.overlays.default ];
  };
in
(pkgs.swiftpm-purifier.buildSwiftPMProject { src = ./.; })
.packages.vapor'
./result/bin/vapor --help
```

To keep the purifier lockfile outside the clone, write it into a flake of
your own with `--lockfile`, and let that flake build the tool from its
source:

```zsh
nix shell 'github:nix-purifiers/swiftpm-purifier#toolchain'
swiftpm-purifier --lockfile \
  ../vapor-toolbox/swiftpm-purifier.lock.json lock
```

```nix
{
  inputs.swiftpm-purifier.url =
    "github:nix-purifiers/swiftpm-purifier";
  inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "swiftpm-purifier/nixpkgs";
  inputs.toolbox = {
    url = "github:vapor/toolbox/20.0.2";
    flake = false;
  };

  outputs =
    {
      nixpkgs,
      swiftpm-purifier,
      toolbox,
      ...
    }:
    let
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      pkgs = import nixpkgs {
        inherit system;
        overlays = [
          swiftpm-purifier.overlays.default
        ];
      };
      project =
        pkgs.swiftpm-purifier.buildSwiftPMProject {
        src = toolbox;
        lockFile = ./swiftpm-purifier.lock.json;
      };
    in
    {
      packages.${system}.default =
        project.packages.vapor;
    };
}
```

To move to a newer release, change the tag in the flake input, and run
`swiftpm-purifier update` in a checkout of that release with the same
`--lockfile`.
