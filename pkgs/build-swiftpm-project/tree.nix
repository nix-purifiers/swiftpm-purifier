# for a package dependency, `.build/artifacts/...` for a binary target),
# and `workspace-state.json.in`, the workspace state lock.nix derives,
# with every package dependency marked as edited. The template names the
# package root `@root@`; whoever links the tree into a package fills it in.
#
# `fetchEntry` comes from the shared purifier library, and turns an entry
# into a store path. `patchArtifact` (patch-artifact.nix) makes the
# prebuilt files of each binary target run under Nix.
